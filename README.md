## Local Installation

### Requirements & Technique Stack

Node.js 12.13.1 / Express 4.17.1
Squelize 5.21.2
NPM 6.12.1
Jest 24.9.0 / Superset 1.0.1

### Clone

```
$ git clone https://github.com/alexander-mathieu/whether_sweater_express.git
$ cd whether_sweater_express
$ npm install
```

### Setup Database

```
$ npx sequelize db:create
$ npx sequelize db:migrate
```

Additionally, you'll need:
* A [DARKSKY_API_KEY](https://darksky.net/dev/), and have it defined within a file in the root directory named `.env`.
* A [GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key/), and have it defined within a file in the root directory named `.env`.

### API Exploration

Once installation and database setup are complete, explore the various API endpoints with the following steps:
* From the `sweater_wheather_express` project directory, boot up a server with `$ npm start`
* Open your browser, and visit `http://localhost:3000/`
* Query the available endpoints by appending to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser

### Running Tests

Tests are implemented with Jest, and can be run with `$ npm test`.

Example of expected output:
```
Test Suites: 4 passed, 4 total
Tests:       15 passed, 15 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        4.725s
